        <h1>What Are Hooks, Exactly?</h1>
        <p>
            "To understand Hooks, we need to take a step back and think about code
            reuse.
    </p>
        <p>
            Today, there are a lot of ways to reuse logic in React apps. We can write
            simple functions and call them to calculate something. We can also write
            components (which themselves could be functions or classes). Components
            are more powerful, but they have to render some UI. This makes them
            inconvenient for sharing non-visual logic. This is how we end up with
            complex patterns like render props and higher-order components. Wouldn’t
            React be simpler if there was just one common way to reuse code instead of
            so many?
    </p>
        <p>
            Functions seem to be a perfect mechanism for code reuse. Moving logic
            between functions takes the least amount of effort. However, functions
            can’t have local React state inside them. You can’t extract behavior like
            “watch window size and update the state” or “animate a value over time”
            from a class component without restructuring your code or introducing an
            abstraction like Observables. Both approaches hurt the simplicity that we
            like about React.
    </p>
        <p>
            Hooks solve exactly that problem. Hooks let you use React features (like
            state) from a function — by doing a single function call. React provides a
            few built-in Hooks exposing the “building blocks” of React: state,
            lifecycle, and context.
    </p>
        <p>
            Since Hooks are regular JavaScript functions, you can combine built-in
            Hooks provided by React into your own “custom Hooks”. This lets you turn
            complex problems into one-liners and share them across your application or
            with the React community."
