This example app is intended to show you how to implement a **React Hook recipes** from [Use Hook](https://usehooks.com/) by Gabe Ragland in your React App.  

"Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8 that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class. This website provides easy to understand code examples to help you learn how hooks work and hopefully inspire you to take advantage of them in your next project"

## About the Darkmode hook (useDarkMode)  

[Live Demo](https://leandrodci.github.io/React-UseDarkMode) || [Link to the Hook](https://usehooks.com/#useDarkMode)   

*Composes: [useMedia](https://usehooks.com/useMedia), [useLocalStorage](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage)*  

"This hook handles all the stateful logic required to add a â˜¾ dark mode toggle to your website. It utilizes localStorage to remember the user's chosen mode, defaults to their browser or OS level setting using the prefers-color-scheme media query and manages the setting of a .dark-mode className on body to apply your styles. 

This post also helps illustrate the power of hook composition. The syncing of state to localStorage is handled by our useLocalStorage hook. Detecting the user's dark mode preference is handled by our useMedia hook. Both of these hooks were created for other use-cases, but here we've composed them to create a super useful hook in relatively few lines of code. It's almost as if hooks bring the compositional power of React components to stateful logic! ðŸ¤¯"
